This room has a large green glow to it. Kal looks around the room and sees a statue with a necklace of some sort of evocation magic. He seriously investigates (rolling a 3) and determines that the largest emerald he has ever seen is just laying there to be taken. He attempted to pick it up and was hit with a fireball. After nearly passing out, he picks up the Necklace of Fireball\nThe group looks around some more, but it appears everything else is just secret tunnels going back to the main chambers. After discussing with Willem and Theodore, Nib and Kal escort them back to Phandalin to speak with Gundrin.\nReturning to Phandalin\r#\r\rUpon arriving back in town, the group met with Gundrin in his rooms. There the two dwarves told the story of what happened:\n They had just cleared into the temple area and were taking their resting shifts. It was Nundro\u0026rsquo;s shift and the woke up to noises. They saw to Drow and a spider man thing walk into the Temple like they were waiting for it be cleared out. They came back out soon after and Nundro called out in challenge. Nundro was quickly overtaken and hauled away with the invadors. They continue to talk about everything else that happened.  Gundrin decides it would be best to head straight to the Wave Echo Cave in the morning.\nIn the morning, Kal ate with Gundrin, Darren and Sildar. Kal let them (Darren and Sildar) know about the encounter with the Orcs and them fleeing from a White dragon. Kal picked up some healing potions and then soon left town with Gundrin, Nib and Siri.\nAbout Gundrin:\r#\r\rHit Points: 26\rArmor Class: 18\rInitiative: -1\rArmor:\rChain Mail\rShield\rWeapons:\rWarhammer\r+4 to hit\r1d8/1d10 + 2\rHandaxe\r+4 to hit\r1d6 + 2 (20/60 range)\rWave Echo Cave\r#\r\rThe group made good time to the cave. It had been some months since Gundrin was last here. As they made their way into the entryway, the group discovered Thardin\u0026rsquo;s corpse. He had been dead for about a week, according to Nib. After a brief bit of mourning, Gundrin decides to continue. He asked that someone take Thardin\u0026rsquo;s boots should anything ill befall him.\nThe group investigated the western portion of the cave. They encountered another goo jelly thing which nearly killed Kal. Nib stepped in with a timely Sacred Flame to end the fight.\nKal and Nib attempted to rest quickly, however they started to hear voices. Instead of resting, Kal and Nib used a potion and some lay on hands to get ready to fight. Kal followed the sound of the voices and eventually found them in an interior room, where three bugbear\u0026rsquo;s attacked.\nBattle Time\r#\r\rLogistics:\r#\r\rInitiative Order:\rGundrin: 6\rNib: 5\rDoggo: 5\rKal: 5\rResources Used:\rHealing Potions:\rKal: 2 Left\rNib: 0 Left\rLay on Hands 10/20 Left\rSpell Slots:\rKal 3/3\rNib 3/3\rHit Die:\rKal 3/4\rNib 4/4\rSiri 3/4\r"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/posts/the_dwarven_excavation/','title':"The Dwarven Excavation",'section':"Posts",'content':"Previously, on Saving Dwarves from Goblins\u0026hellip;\r#\r\rKal, Nib, Siri and Droop went through the Cragmaw Castle and successfully rescued Gundrin Rockseeker. On the way back, they shared news with Gundrin and Gundrin opened up a little more about what he and his brother\u0026rsquo;s are doing.\nReturning to Phandalin.\r#\r\rUpon arriving in Phandalin, Gundrin departed ways with the group as Barthen\u0026rsquo;s provisions to speak further with Barthen. Gundrin said he would catch up with Kal at the Stonehill Inn. Hoping to avoid unncessary questions, Nib and Droop headed to Quill\u0026rsquo;s house and were going to see if Quill would take Droop in as an extra farmhand. Kal went to the Lionshield Coster and sold off the goods and wares he found. In addition, he mentioned to Linene that there were more goods at the Castle \u0026ndash; however he was uncertain if the castle was safe to go to.\nKal then made his way to the Stonehill inn, where he found Sildar and Darren speaking at a table. Kal let them know that he was successful in finding and rescuing Gundrin and that the goblins who were squating in the abandoned castle were all killed. Kal also returned Sildar\u0026rsquo;s mail and longsword to him.\nCatching up on events from while he was out of town, Darren has been selected as a temporary Town Master, until such time an election for a permanent one can take place. Sildar will be moving into Harbin\u0026rsquo;s house as Phandalin is brought into the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Alliance fold. The Tresendar Manor will be utilized as a jail, given it is equipped for that.\nShortly after, Gundrin entered the Stonehill Inn and spoke briefly with the group, indicating he would like a private audience with the group to discuss the work his brother and him are up to.\nGundrin\u0026rsquo;s Story\r#\r\rAfter a brief rest, where Kal was able to get a bath, have some food, and get Nib from her sisters house, everyone met at Sildar\u0026rsquo;s residence. Here Gundrin started his story.\nHe and his brother\u0026rsquo;s have discovered the Lost Mines of Phandelver, which is approximately 15 miles due east of Phandalin. They have confirmed the location of Wave Echo Cave and have moved around in there. He and his brothers would like to restart the forge. In order to do that, they need to find some keys.\nThe Four Keys\r#\r\rGundrin and his brothers are looking for four keys which operate the forge. They already have the first key, which was held by a descendent of the Tresendar line. That was the human key. There are two dwarven keys, one which they believe are at a dwarven temple; the other they believe is located in the Dwarven Castle of Axeholm.\nThe Human Key:\r#\r\r Retreived by the dwarves in the ruins of Conyberry from a descendent of the Tresendar line. They didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to know what it was for other than being old. Currently held by Thardin, Gundrin\u0026rsquo;s brother who is in Wave Echo Cave waiting.  The Dwarven Keys:\r#\r\r Dwarven Temple Key  This key is being searched for by Nundrow, Gundrin\u0026rsquo;s other brother. He has two assistants with him: Willem and Theodore.   Axeholm Key  Said to be hidden somewhere \u0026ndash; did not get information as to the specifics    The Gnomish Key:\r#\r\r The key is to be in Gnomenguard and held there by the gnomes. Gundrin wanted to find the other keys first prior to bringing the gnomes into the fold on his plans.  About Gnomenguard\r#\r\rDarren added some information in about Gnomenguard. He mentioned that it is a group of very reclusive rock Gnomes. Last he knew, there were 15 gnomes who made their home there. There are two kings who rule the 15 gnomes; Nerkly and Korbaz. Darren mentioned using caution with them. Darren also mentioned that the gnomes there drink a mushroom team which makes them see funny things. The city is near a waterfall so it is typically misty/steamy around there. Darren also cautioned on using magic in Gnomenguard \u0026ndash; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t behave as one would expect.\nGundrin\u0026rsquo;s Request:\r#\r\rGundrin asked Kal and Nib if they would go check in on Nundrow. There was a brief discussion about how they would validate who they are with him, and Gundrin said he would make some documents and provide some information. In the morning, he provided Kal with the following:\n A sealed letter with his signet ring imprinted in it. The dwarvish word for friend. Tell Nundrow \u0026ldquo;I am a mellon\u0026rdquo;  The Ruined Temple\r#\r\rProvisioned with mounts from Darren, Kal and Nib were able to make an uneventful ride to the Dwarven Temple. Upon arriving at the temple, all was eerily quiet. As they made their way to the entrance, Nib overheard two creatures talking. Kal called out to them and it turned out to be Willem and Theodore, however not Nundrow.\nTwo days before, the ruins were attacked by spiderlike bipedal men. Nundrow was captured and taken. Theodore and Willem hid as best as they could. Then today, they were forced to hide again as three Orcs had entered inside the ruined Temple. Kal decided to go in and see if the Orcs knew anything of what was going on.\nAn altercation occurs\u0026hellip;\r#\r\rUpon entering, Kal was immediately beset by two large piles of Goo. One of the files of Goo had the corpse of an Orc inside of it. Siri and Nib layed down some solid attacks, while Kal initially wiffed pretty badly. While fighting the Goos, two Orcs ran out and threw some Javalins at the Goo. The combined efforts killed the first goo, while Kal was able to critically hit the Goo and mostly kill it in one attack.\nAfter killing the Goo, Kal attempted to find out what the Orcs were doing here. They said that they had lived on the mountain and were forced to flee or be killed by a white Dragon. The Orcs said they would use this as their new home. Kal, atttempting to be civil with the Orcs, informed them that this building was already taken by Dwarves. There was some back and forth between the Orcs and Kal, given they couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any dwarves. Finally, words failed and it resolved into combat.\nSiri was knocked out by a critical Axe hit from one of the Orcs. Furious that they attempted to kill his dog, Kal waded into the combat and lashed out at one of the Orcs. Nib joined in, using her Wand of Burning Hands to ignite the Orcs, killing one instantly. Kal then took it upon himself to finish off the last Orcs standing.\nLoot:\r#\r\r 2x Greataxe  Dora the Explorer Kal, The Great Seer of Not Many Things\r#\r\rAfter the fight, Kal and Nib started to look around to see what could be found in this room. Looking at one of the support columns, Nib was able to find some dwarven heads and a stone coffer with 15 gemstones. They then followed the hidden path that the Orcs came from, finding a room with three stone beds and a hidden compartment which had already been rifled through (North East Hidden Room). Continuing, Nib found another Secret Wall which lead to a Vestery, containing nothings but some moldering robes. Kal did notice that these robes were Red. This would indicate that the priests here who used those robes were vestments for Priests of Abbathor, which was the Dwarven God of Greed.\nAs they continued to search, they found some more Hallways with dead ends. Nib patiently explained to Kal on ways to detect hidden doors, as he could not understand why someone woul make dead end hallways. They proceeded to a room in the south east and found a crushed dwarf who was long dead. They found a necklace of a tiny jeweled dagger on a silver chain.\nFinally, Nib was able to notice some greenish light through a cave in. The team is going to work on excavating this debree from the field.\nLoot:\r#\r\r 15 Gemstones pg.23 DOIP  Experience Awarded:\r#\r\r 367 xp  "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/posts/cragmaw_castle/','title':"Cragmaw Castle",'section':"Posts",'content':"Notes From the Last Session:\r#\r\rSildar tasked Nib, Droop, Siri and Kal to head to the Cragmaw Castle to look for Gundrin Rockseeker, based off of the information that the group was able to gather from the Redbrands and from what Droop was able to offer as well.\nJourney to Cragmaw Castle:\r#\r\rKal, Nib and Siri went back out to the Tresendar manor to talk with Droop, as they need a guide to the Cragmaw Castle. Droop was willing and offerred to take them there. They then ran back into town to pick up some supplies. Kal upgraded his armor and he also purchased a hand crossbow for Droop. They then returned to the Tresendar manor. The group was able to hike around town through the woods, to try to avoid the townsfolk seeing Droop.\nWhile on the road, the group encountered an Ogre eating a deer carcass in the middle of the Triboar trail. It saw them and attacked and was swiftly defeated from some exceptional hand crossbow shots from Droop. They continued on and were soon off the road and on the path to the Cragmaw Castle. About a mile out from the castle, the group went off path and bunkered down for the night. They were able to rest and get ready to attack in the morning.\nAs they were getting ready for bed, Droop was able to provide some intellgence on the castle. The main entrance was to the west, with a backdoor entrance to the south. Both of these could be well guarded, depending on how diligent the Goblins were being. Droop said that there were Goblins, Hobgolbins and Bugbears in the building. There was also a secret entrance to the north which avoided some of the lookout points. After discsusing with the group, it was decided to use the North.\nAssault on Cragmaw Castle\r#\r\rIn the morning the group made their way around the castle and to the north. They were able to spot the camoflauged entrance and decided to make a run in for it. Siri got distracted by a squirrel, however things were fine for getting in.\nHobgoblins\r#\r\rThe group made their way east. While waiting to check out a door, Kal peered around a heavy curtain while banging against the wall in his new armor. Two Hobgoblins attacked. Kal and the group were able to fend off the Hobgoblins and kill them without alerting others in the area.\nLoot:\r#\r\r 2 Chain Shirts 2 Longbows 2 Longswords  King Grol and Company\r#\r\rAfter returning to the door and listening, Nib could hear arguing coming from the other room. Droop stated that this was King Grol\u0026rsquo;s chambers. Kal decided the best way to handle this was go come charging in. Upon entering, Kal found himself face to face to the Glassstaff again. Wasting no time, he and the party focused on the Glassstaff and the one Redbrand with him. King Grol stepped back, holding his wolf. Nib and Droop stayed out in the hallway while Kal and Siri did the upfront attacking. The Glasstaff died and turned into a Doppleganger again.\nNib, who didn\u0026rsquo;t have the clearest view of what was going on, attacked the wolf as it was aggressively lunging towards Kal. This caused King Grol to go into a rage. He ran after Nib to attempt to kill her, however Droop was able to critically hit Grol and soon after Grol and the wolf were both dead.\nIn looking around the room, there was a locked room off of the King\u0026rsquo;s chambers. They found a lock and were able to unlock it. Low and behold, a dirty and dishearted Gundrin Rockseeker was found. Searching through the room, they were able to find some gold and Gundrin\u0026rsquo;s map of Wave Echo Cave.\nGundrin was very much looking forward to getting out of the Castle, however Kal could not leave without trying to find out more information about the Black Spider. After discussing this further, Gundrin locked himself back in his cell while the group continued through the Castle.\nLoot:\r#\r\r Gundrin Gundrin\u0026rsquo;s Map 220 silver 160 Electrum Morningstar Scrimitar  The Owlbear\r#\r\rThe group continued to make their way through the castle and found a locked door. Upon unlocking it, a screaming raging Owlbear attacked Kal. The combined efforts of the entire group allowed for them to kill the beast. In looking around the Owlbear\u0026rsquo;s room, Kal noticed a box about 2 stories up in the ruined tower. Droop was able to get up there and push it down, however Kal failed to catch the box. Inside of the chest were gold and two spell scrolls; one of silence and one of revivify, as well as 6 healing potions.\nLoot:\r#\r\r 90 Electrum 120 Gold Scroll of Silence Scroll of Revivify 6 healing potions  Room O\u0026rsquo;Goblins\r#\r\rThe group continued through the dark, clearing out this building. Kal attempted to descretely opened up a door, however it screeched like a banshee on a bad hair day and a room of 10 goblins were made aware of Kal\u0026rsquo;s presence. Kal ran in and was able to fear the majority of the goblins, followed by systematic slaughter. All but one of the Goblin\u0026rsquo;s was killed. Droop was able to get his revenge on the Goblin cook, spending time in combat pissing and jumping on the cook.\nLoot:\r#\r\r 10 Scrimitar 9 Shortbows 1 Longsword  Goblin Sentries\r#\r\rAs the group made their way to the west, Siri sensed onto some Goblins in sentry rooms facing west. Kal, Droop and Siri were able to make quick work of four goblins who were waiting in rooms with arrow slits facing west.\nLoot:\r#\r\r 4 Scrimitar 4 Shortbows  A group of Hobgoblins\r#\r\rIn the Northwest portion of the castle, Kal encountered four Hobgoblins in tight quarters. This was a right proper fight. Kal was one hit away from going down, as was Siri. After killing the Hobgoblins, the group moved into the room to take a short rest. While resting, they found what appears to be Sildar\u0026rsquo;s armor and sword.\nLoot:\r#\r\r 5 Spears 4 Longswords 3 Morningstars 2 Greatswords 1 Finely Crafted Quarter Staff (p.38 LMOP) 4 Chain Mail 4 Longswords 4 Shields 4 Longbows Sildar\u0026rsquo;s Mail Sildar\u0026rsquo;s Longsword  Ritual Room\r#\r\rAfter resting, Kal and the group made a mad dash into a room. While running in, Kal noticed a Goblin going through what appeared to be some sort of demonic ritual. Kal used the rest of his power for the day to smite the ritual casting Goblin. One other goblin was slain and then the final one ran out.\nJust south of the Ritual room, the group encountered a plant like monster that attacked them. The group was able to kill that. At this point, the entire building was cleared out by the group. Unfortunately, they had not managed to gather any other information regarding the Black Spider.\nLoot:\r#\r\r Knife, Censor, Challace (Ritual Casting Gear) Scrimitar Shortbow Statue of Sun Elf p.38 LMOP  Venderbot\r#\r\r 16 - Scrimitar (200g vendor) 14 - Shortbow (175g vendor) 6 - Longbows (150g vendor) 4 - Morningstars (30g vendor) 5 - Spears (2g5s vendor) 10 - Longswords (75g vendor) 4 - Shields (10g vendor) 4 - Chain Mail (150g vendor) 2 - Chain Shirts (50g)  Total Vendored Items\n 842 gold and 5 silver  Between Session RP:\r#\r\rOn the way back to Phandelin, Gundren is obviously very gracious for the rescue. He\u0026rsquo;s not as energized as he was when you last saw him. In fact he\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit more humbled and seems very nervous.\n He doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about a \u0026ldquo;Black Spider\u0026rdquo; or any plots to take over Phandelin. He was last there about a month and a week ago by this point and it sounds like things have changed very rapidly. He knew about the \u0026ldquo;Red Brands\u0026rdquo; but wasn\u0026rsquo;t concerned as they seemed few in numbers and somewhat useless. The Townmaster hired them because rumors of bandits and robbery had been reported in town happening on the Tribor trail East of Phandelin. Since he was heading West in the Tribor and North on the High Road he wasn\u0026rsquo;t too concerned. However, similar rumors had been reported in Neverwinter and that\u0026rsquo;s why he put out the advertisement for adventurers. Sildar was a chance meeting in Neverwinter and the two decided to team up since they were heading to the same location. Gundren knew of Iarno Albrecht (Glass Staff), but paid him no mind, they had no business together. Gundren and his brothers have discovered several things:  A. The Location of the fabled \u0026ldquo;Wave Echo Cave\u0026rdquo; B. A map that supposedly is the layout of Wave Echo Cave\u0026rsquo;s inner chambers and tunnels that is a copy of a copy of a copy, etc. from the journal of a Dwarf adventurer named Urmon (you have his journal, FYI) C. In order to operate the Forge of Spells four magic keys must be used. The keys have been spread all over the region. Gundren and his brothers know the locations.    RE: Barrel(s) at Cragmaw Castle\nThe barrels contained old salted meats, sacks of rotting grain, and a small barrel (cask) of Dwarven Brandy (you know it\u0026rsquo;s Dwarven, and brandy, because there\u0026rsquo;s a burned-in brand stamp on the side that say\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Barundar\u0026rsquo;s Bawdy Brandy.)\u0026rdquo; Also a bloodied suit of chain mail, heavy crossbow and an unsheathed longsword bearing the emblem of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Alliance in the hilt.\nRE: Keys and Brothers\n\u0026ldquo;HAR! My Brothers! Safe as babes, I\u0026rsquo;m sure. Nundro is off with a couple other Dwarves, Willam and Theador, at an ancient Dwarven Temple about 15 miles SouthWest of Phandelin. They are excavating the temple in search of one of the keys. When I left them there was quite a mess to deal with as Earthquakes had destroyed the area quite some time ago. And Tharden is posted up at the Cave itself. Nobody know'\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s location, so I\u0026rsquo;m sure he\u0026rsquo;s just biding his time. Probably getting bored to tears. Perhaps when we get back to Phandelin you could check in on Nundro while I recuperate in town.\u0026quot;\nRE: Dragon Talk\n\u0026ldquo;WHAT!!?? dragonS!!! did you say DRAGONS!!!??\u0026rdquo; Emphasizing the plural of the word. \u0026ldquo;I had heard rumors of a young Green Dragon in the area. It\u0026rsquo;d been seen on the Western edges of Neverwinter Wood. But now you\u0026rsquo;re telling me that there\u0026rsquo;s a White Dragon as well? In the South? Hmmm\u0026hellip;. I don\u0026rsquo;t like this one bit. It seems that someone, or something, this \u0026lsquo;black Spider,\u0026rsquo; as you called it, knows what my brothers and I are up to. Maybe these dragons\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;have heard rumors of untold wealth returning to Phandelin and are biding their time? Please, Check on Nundro when we return.\u0026quot;\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/posts/the_adventure_thus/','title':"The Adventure Thus Far...",'section':"Posts",'content':"Backstory:\r#\r\rDown on his luck and without any prospects in Neverwinter, Kal Windrunner looked up a dwarf by the name of Gundrin Rockseeker for an escort job from Neverwinter to some woodtick down in the south called Phandalin. Gundrin also had hired an old drunk by the name of Pete and a halfling healer named Nib. In addition, a member of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Alliance, Sildar Hallwinter would ride south with them as well.\nEvermist, Part I\r#\r\rAfter a day of slow travel on the road, Sildar and Gundrin went ahead of the group to travel to Phandalin at a quicker pace than the oxen would allow. The group proceeded south, encountering a group from a town down the road who was heading to Neverwinter, as their town had been attacked by Goblins and burned. When Kal, Nib and Pete arrived in Neverwinter, they heard that the blacksmith\u0026rsquo;s daughter had been taken by Goblins.\nKal and his groups met with other members of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Alliance and went back into the woods with their local commander to find the little girl. The path took them into the Neverwinter Woods, eventually finding the hideout where the goblins were located. The group quickly dispatched of the sentries and made their way into the a crypt. There additional goblins were combatted and killed. Finally, the group found the last room with a hobgoblin and several other goblins. The other goblins were going throught a ritual sacrafice of the young child. The group was able to kill the goblins, save the child, and take the Hobgoblin hostage.\nKal and the commander questioned the Hobgoblin and found out that he was supposed to be watching the road for a dwarf traveling south from Neverwinter and capture him, however the goblins disobeyed the hobgoblin\u0026rsquo;s orders. Several intimitdation checks later, the Hobgoblin provided a map of the area and stated that the black spider had sent them, then clammed up. The child was returned to the blacksmith and the Hobgoblin was brought back to the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Alliance tower for further questioning and future execution. Nib gathered the ritual casting gear and a wand we later found out was a Wand of Eldrich Blaster.\nEvermist, Part II\r#\r\rAs part of questioning the Hobgoblin, they found out that there was some sort of hidden undead off of the crypt. Kal, Nib and Pete went back to the crypts, found the hidden entrance, then were attacked by several undead wraiths. There we put to a final rest and the group found an elven blade of high quality (The Horde Sword). The group then returned to Evermist and started to head south down the road to head to Phandalin. As they headed south, the group noticed two large flying figures \u0026ndash; they appeared to be two dragons between the ruins of Thundertree and Neverwinter.\nOn the road again, off the road again\r#\r\rWhile on the road to the south, the group encountered two dead horses which looked familiar to Gundrin and Sildar\u0026rsquo;s horses. While investigating the horses, the group was set upon by Goblins. They were able to defend themselves and kill several goblins, while several others got away to the south. While looking around the countryside, they found a Goblin path heading to the north. They proceeded to follow it up until they found a cave.\nCragmaw Cave/Hideout\r#\r\rUpon entering the cave, they encountered several wolves on chains. After killing one, the group backed off as the goblins nearby seem to think it was just the wolves fighting. The group then went up the west side and jumped up a high incline. They made some noise and a goblin attacked and then attempted to run away. Siri was able to run down the goblin before it was able to get away. They then encountered a large group of goblins, including a goblin leader. The Goblin Leader was going to execute Sildar infront of the group, however some well timed shots from Pete and Kal charging in was able to prevent the worst from happened. Eventually the goblins were defeated and put the sword, however it did tire out the group. Nib recovered a wand from the leader, which we found to be a Wand of Burning Hands.\nAfter completing a short rest, the group moved through the rest of the cave. Here they encountered more goblins and Bugbear named Klarg. Klarg never had a chance to say anything, as even Sildar wiffing on both of his attacks, Kal, Pete and Nib were able to finish off Klarg. One goblin escaped, however Sildar was saved and a large cache of Lionshield Coster goods were found.\nSweet Home\u0026hellip;Phandalin?\r#\r\rThe group, plus Sildar had an uneventful travel on the road to Phandalin. Kal and team were able to drop off the cart at Barthen\u0026rsquo;s Provisions. It was first here that we heard about the Redbrands causing trouble in town. Sildar rented the group rooms at the Stonehill inn as thanks for a night. Nib and Kal went to the Lionshield Coster to let the person running it know where the goods are. Kal met Miss Linene Graywind, a female elf who runs the shop. While Barthen described her as a snob and hard to work with, Linene seemed pleased with the information Kal provided and promised a reward and her favor should this pan out.\nKal and Nib then headed to Nib\u0026rsquo;s sisters house (Quill). After meeting Quill and having some lunch, it was discovered that the Redbrands in town had killed a war buddy from Kal\u0026rsquo;s army days, Tucks Dendar. Quill provides some information that the town master (Harbin Wester) hired the Redbrands for protection but they seem to be extorting money out of people. Tucks\u0026rsquo; wife and child have also not been seen since the murder. Talk went back to news from the road and talk of dragons. Nib and Kal let Quill know that there do seem to be two dragons flying from the Neverwinter Woods. This caused Quill to be concerned.\nQuill also had a favor to ask of Nib and Kal. There is an alchemist who lives south of town several hours away. Given the dragons flying around, she asked if we could go get the old lady alchemist from her house. Nib and Kal left town and arrived at the home to discover a wounded Manticore attacking the house. The group was able to communicate with it and provide it with some healing and food, and the Manticore (Brian) told them that he and his kind were attacked and had to flee from their homeland by a White Dragon to the south named Kryovain.\nThe Redbrand Threat\r#\r\rAfter arriving back in Phandalin, Nib and Kal dropped off the alchemist and Quills house and went back to rest for the night. The next morning they headed out to Darren Edermath\u0026rsquo;s orchard, as Kal recalled stories from Tucks regarding Darren\u0026rsquo;s checkered past as an adventuer. Kal found out more about the Redbrands attempting to extort town members. Darren also dropped a bunch of knowledge regarding Phandalin\u0026rsquo;s history and the Lost Mine of Phandelver. He proceeded to freak out Kal about him becoming a dragon slayer in the future. On the bright side, he did offer Kal a piece of his adventuring gear, a helm that will allow Kal to see in the dark.\nAfter leaving Darren\u0026rsquo;s, Kal returned to the inn to discover Sildar waiting for him. Sildar attempted to speak to the town master and was rebuffed. In addition, the information he was able to gather regarding the Redbrands was not promising. Sildar offerred 500g to Kal and Nib if they could take care of the Redbrand threat in the city. Sildar also had not heard anything about the missing Lord\u0026rsquo;s Alliance member he was looking for: Iarno Albreck.\nAttack on the Redbrand Hideout\r#\r\rNib, Siri and Kal were shown a way to the hideout from Quill\u0026rsquo;s son (Carp). From there, they made their way through the woods and were able to ambush three Redbrands lolling around as centry. As they entered in the cave under the old manor house, Kal immediately was being psychicly probed by as Nothig. After some back and forth bantering between Nothig and Kal, Kal jumped down and with a holy critical, one shot the beast to death. Here he found some spell scrolls, jewels, and a hammer that started yelling as soon as he touched it. He stowed it for now and continued on.\nThe group encountered a room with three bugbears and a goblin. The goblin fainted and the bugbears attacked. While the group did take some damage, they remained victorious. They then spoke with the Goblin, whos name was Droop and wer able to gather more information. The Glasstaff is a Redbrand mage who was working for the Black Spider, who appears to be an elf (drow?) The elf was using the Cragmaw Goblins to reinforce the Redbrands to keep Phandalin under control. The Goblin Kings sent the bugbears and Droop to reinforce the town. Given Droop\u0026rsquo;s information sharing, the team sent him outside and freed him.\nNib, Siri and Kal continued on, encountering 4 more Redbands which they dispatched of quickly. Droop came back offering to help, so Kal and Nib let him follow them. They then went into another room which they discovered to be a wizard\u0026rsquo;s work room. Siri attacked a small rodent which turned out to be a familiar. They then heard noise from a fake door and started to chase down the person who was running. They were finally able to catch up in a crypt room, which they encountered 3 undead wraiths, the Glassstaff and a redbrand. After getting magic missiled repeatedly, Kal was able to kill the Glassstaff and help his friends finish off the other threats.\nKal decided it was important to ensure the building was secure. He went through the rest of the building, falling into a trap he knew was there do to some very poor jumping, and then finding two defenseless Redbrands who were sleeping and subsequently were butchered and killed.\nWith the area secure, Droop was able to unlock the prisoner\u0026rsquo;s here (Tucks\u0026rsquo; family) and then smuggle them back out to Quills house. While going over the items they discovered from the Wizard\u0026rsquo;s quarters, it was discovered that the Glasstaff was actually Iarno Albreck \u0026ndash; the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Alliance member that Sildar was looking for. The documents make it seem like he was working directly for the Black Spider.\nFinishing the Redbrand Threat\r#\r\rExhausted from the fight after having expending all of their resources, Nib and Kal decided it would be best to remove the rest of the Redbrands from Phandalin. Given their current state, they went to seek assistance from Sildar. Sildar was hesistent to assist, but after some convincing, decided to join the group. Kal was questioning Sildar\u0026rsquo;s waryness given he was paying them to remove the Redbrands. Siri was growling at Sildar, which made Kal\u0026rsquo;s mind up. Kal attacked Sildar and after a bit, Nib also joined in. They were able to knock out Sildar and once that happened, he morphed into a blue humanoid creature. Kal and Nib had never seen anything like that. Kal went back to the inn and found that Sildar had been attacked and was being held captive. Kal freed Sildar and they proceded to the Sleeping Giant Inn, where the Redbrands had been staying.\nUpon arriving, a scuffle occurred with three Redbrands hanging around outside of the building. The fight lead to the inside where all but on of the Redbrands were put to the sword. Kal had a slight disagreement with the Bar owner, however Sildar stepped in to smooth things over. They took the one Redbrand captive. After discussing where to keep the Redbrand and the blue man, they decided to move them into the cells under the Tresendar Manor. Droop and Sildar stayed to keep watch while Nib, Siri and Kal took a rest.\nAfter the rest, Kal went through the hideout looking for any arcane or magical objects. After searching the building, Kal found a platinum signet ring which had not been discovered before. Kal then rejoined Droop and Sildar and they questioned the blue man (doppleganger). They found out a bit more about the Black Spider (was sending people here to get the town in order and help the Glassstaff). The Doppleganger started to do some mental trickery with Sildar. After a brief discussion about how to properly hold someone like this, Sildar and Kal executed the Doppleganger.\nRedbrand Aftermath\r#\r\rNib and Kal shared the information they had recovered from the Tresendar mannor \u0026ndash; it appears that the Glasstaff was actually Iarno, with Sildar. In addition, they shared the information that Droop was able to provide as well. It appears that there are many parties involved with trying to shape how Phandalin will be controlled.\nSildar shares that he believes the townmaster needs to be removed and someone else needs to be put in charge. They suggest that the next day they go to meet with Harbin Wester.\nIn the morning, Nib and Kal go back out to Darren\u0026rsquo;s to see if he can help identify some of the magical items they found. While Darren wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to give specifics, they were able to get some historical information on some of the items, such as the hammer and the ring; both of which appear to have been wielded and lost by the former Lord Tresendar.\nHarbin Wester.\r#\r\rAfter returning to the Inn from Darren\u0026rsquo;s, Nib, Siri and Kal join Sildar to go speak and receive Harbin Wester of control of the town. Harbin is very confrontational. Kal commanded Harbin outside, where he proceded to knock out Sildar in one atack. Nib was able to revive him. Siri went around the house to a side door and was able to get an opportunity attack and knock Harbin prone. From there the group was able to attack and permanently subdue Harbin\u0026hellip;who was a Doppleganger. The group then searched the house and found the real Harbin Wester locked up in his own cellar. After talking with Harbin, it sounds like he had been locked up for more than a month in his own cellar. He was done with the town and done with being Townmaster.\nA New Phandalin\r#\r\rThe next day Kal spoke with Sildar. Given Harbin\u0026rsquo;s soon to be departure from the Town Master role, Sildar was concerned about who should be the new Town Master. He didn\u0026rsquo;t want to lead as a town outsider. Kal decided to poke around town and see what the prominent townsfolk thought.\n Barthen: Would prefer if none of the business owners were Town Master \u0026ndash; do not want to have favortism in place. Thought Darren would do an okay job as Townmaster. Linene: Didn\u0026rsquo;t seem interested in the job \u0026ndash; has enough to do with the Lionshield Coster. Was happy to hear about more of her stolen goods being under the manner. Gave favor to Kal for providing information and in addition gave some gold to him. Halia: Thinks she should be the Town Master. Offered to have friends look into the Black Spider people. Nib was wary of here \u0026ndash; Halia has unsavory contacts with criminals from other towns. Toblen Stonehill \u0026ndash; Thinks that Darren would do a good job of being Town Master. Smithy \u0026ndash; Smitten with Kal for cleaning up the trash from town. Thinks Kal or Darren should be town master.  Kal relayed this information to Sildar. Sildar and Kal are both concerned with what happened to Gundrin and his brothers. Sildar asks Kal and Nib to go to the \u0026lsquo;Castle\u0026rsquo; that Droop described and see if Gundrin is being held there. Sildar is going to stay in town and try to get things stabilized.\nKal meets with Tucks\u0026rsquo; family. Tucks\u0026rsquo; wife has nothing to pay for Kal getting them out, however she does tell Kal about a family heirloom that is in the ruins of Thundertree. It is Kals if he would like to go up there and get it.\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/docs/player_characters/','title':"Player Controlled Characters",'section':"Docs",'content':"Kaladin (Kal) [PC]\r#\r\r\rKal on DNDBeyond\nStats:\r#\r\r   Max HP AC Inititive Prof B Total/Hit Die Used     32 17/19 +0 2 Untracked        Strength Dexterity Constitution Intellect Wisdom Charisma     Modifier +3 0 +1 -1 +1 +4   Score 16 11 12 9 12 18   Saving Throw +3 0 +1 -1 +3 +6    Skills:\r#\r\r Athletics: +5 Insight: +3 Intimidation: +6 Perception: +3 Persuassion: + 6  Background/Story:\r#\r\rNib [Sidekick]\r#\r\rStats:\r#\r\r   Max HP AC Inititive Prof B Total/Used Hit Die     22 13 +1 2 3/0        Strength Dexterity Constitution Intellect Wisdom Charisma     Modifier 0 +1 0 +2 +2 +1   Score 10 12 10 15 16 13   Saving Throw +0 +1 +0 +3 +4 +1    Skills:\r#\r\r Arcana: +4 Investigation: +4 Religion: +4  Items Held:\r#\r\r \rWand of Eldrich Blast 1/13 Used \rWand of Burning Hands \rStaff of Defense  Spellscasting\r#\r\rSpell Slots\r#\r\r Level 1: 3  Spells: (DC13 / +5 Hit)\r#\r\r  Cantrips:\n Guidance (Concentration)  Casting Time: 1 Action Components: V,S Duration: 1 Minute Range: Touch You touch one willing creature.

It says that it\u0026rsquo;s the journal of an adventurer named Urmon, and it describes The Recorded Histories of the Lost Mine of Phandelver and the Forge of Spells. Many of the pages have given way to time and whole sections are missing.\nWhat you are able to glean from the available text is this: Approximately 350 years ago, The Phandelver\u0026rsquo;s Pact was formed in the region that is now Phandalin and the Neverwinder Woods, on the Northern Sword Coast, when a long forgotten clan of Dwarves made an agreement with a group of Gnomes of unparalleled engineering skill to share ownership of a rich mine located in the Wave Echo Cave. The pact created a lot of wealth for the parties and the surrounding lands, drawing both admiration and envy. Later, a group of powerful Human wizards joined the agreement since the mine also contained strong magical energies and material, where a powerful new forge was crafted: the Forge of Spells. Powerful magical items were commissioned and created within. As the fame of the forge grew, the nearby settlement of Phandalin also prospered and attracted lots of attention. Disaster struck, however, as Orcs swept the North, laying waste to all in their path. Reinforced by evil mercenary wizards, the orcs battled through the mines to seize its treasure and riches. Human wizards fought bravely alongside their Drawven and Gnomish allies to defend the Forge of Spells but to no avail. The ensuing battle was a grand one and much of the cavern was destroyed. Tremors and cave-ins meant heavy casualties and few, if any survived. Meanwhile, the original settlement of Phandalin was also wiped out by the Orcs and the mine was lost to the ages, as was all knowledge of the Phandelver Pact.\nIn addition, Urman records that a magic Hammer named The Lightbringer was commissioned in honor of the God, Lathander, for a great knight named Aldith Tresendar, known as the Black Hawk. The mages working with the gnomes and dwarves of the Phandelver\u0026rsquo;s Pact created such a weapon, but the hammer was lost when Sir Aldith died fighting off the orcs that attacked through the hidden caverns below his manor\nStatue of Sun Elf\r#\r\rNotes:\n LMOP p. 38  Finely Crafted Quarter Staff\r#\r\rNotes:\n LMOP p. 38  Necklace of Fireballs\r#\r\r Currently held by Kal Has 4 charges left of a third level fireball.
