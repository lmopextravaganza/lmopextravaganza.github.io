      <description>Clearing out the Temple#With the help of Theodore and Willem, the group is able to clear out a path to a caved in room. This room has a large green glow to it. Kal looks around the room and sees a statue with a necklace of some sort of evocation magic. He seriously investigates (rolling a 3) and determines that the largest emerald he has ever seen is just laying there to be taken.</description>

      <description>Previously, on Saving Dwarves from Goblins&amp;hellip;#Kal, Nib, Siri and Droop went through the Cragmaw Castle and successfully rescued Gundrin Rockseeker. On the way back, they shared news with Gundrin and Gundrin opened up a little more about what he and his brother&amp;rsquo;s are doing.
Returning to Phandalin.#Upon arriving in Phandalin, Gundrin departed ways with the group as Barthen&amp;rsquo;s provisions to speak further with Barthen. Gundrin said he would catch up with Kal at the Stonehill Inn.</description>

      <description>Notes From the Last Session:#Sildar tasked Nib, Droop, Siri and Kal to head to the Cragmaw Castle to look for Gundrin Rockseeker, based off of the information that the group was able to gather from the Redbrands and from what Droop was able to offer as well.
Journey to Cragmaw Castle:#Kal, Nib and Siri went back out to the Tresendar manor to talk with Droop, as they need a guide to the Cragmaw Castle.</description>

      <description>Backstory:#Down on his luck and without any prospects in Neverwinter, Kal Windrunner looked up a dwarf by the name of Gundrin Rockseeker for an escort job from Neverwinter to some woodtick down in the south called Phandalin. Gundrin also had hired an old drunk by the name of Pete and a halfling healer named Nib. In addition, a member of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Alliance, Sildar Hallwinter would ride south with them as well.</description>
