Gundrin also had hired an old drunk by the name of Pete and a halfling healer named Nib. In addition, a member of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Alliance, Sildar Hallwinter would ride south with them as well.\nEvermist, Part I\r#\r\rAfter a day of slow travel on the road, Sildar and Gundrin went ahead of the group to travel to Phandalin at a quicker pace than the oxen would allow. The group proceeded south, encountering a group from a town down the road who was heading to Neverwinter, as their town had been attacked by Goblins and burned. When Kal, Nib and Pete arrived in Neverwinter, they heard that the blacksmith\u0026rsquo;s daughter had been taken by Goblins.\nKal and his groups met with other members of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Alliance and went back into the woods with their local commander to find the little girl. The path took them into the Neverwinter Woods, eventually finding the hideout where the goblins were located. The group quickly dispatched of the sentries and made their way into the a crypt. There additional goblins were combatted and killed. Finally, the group found the last room with a hobgoblin and several other goblins. The other goblins were going throught a ritual sacrafice of the young child. The group was able to kill the goblins, save the child, and take the Hobgoblin hostage.\nKal and the commander questioned the Hobgoblin and found out that he was supposed to be watching the road for a dwarf traveling south from Neverwinter and capture him, however the goblins disobeyed the hobgoblin\u0026rsquo;s orders. Several intimitdation checks later, the Hobgoblin provided a map of the area and stated that the black spider had sent them, then clammed up. The child was returned to the blacksmith and the Hobgoblin was brought back to the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Alliance tower for further questioning and future execution.\nEvermist, Part II\r#\r\rAs part of questioning the Hobgoblin, they found out that there was some sort of hidden undead off of the crypt. Kal, Nib and Pete went back to the crypts, found the hidden entrance, then were attacked by several undead wraiths. There we put to a final rest and the group found an elven blade of high quality (The Horde Sword). The group then returned to Evermist and started to head south down the road to head to Phandalin.\nOn the road again, off the road again\r#\r\rWhile on the road to the south, the group encountered two dead horses which looked familiar to Gundrin and Sildar\u0026rsquo;s horses. While investigating the horses, the group was set upon by Goblins. They were able to defend themselves and kill several goblins, while several others got away to the south. While looking around the countryside, they found a Goblin path heading to the north. They proceeded to follow it up until they found a cave.\nCragmaw Cave/Hideout\r#\r\r"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/docs/player_characters/','title':"Player Controlled Characters",'section':"Docs",'content':"Kaladin (Kal) [PC]\r#\r\r\rKal on DNDBeyond\nStats:\r#\r\r   Max HP AC Inititive Prof B Total/Hit Die Used     32 17/19 +0 2 Untracked        Strength Dexterity Constitution Intellect Wisdom Charisma     Modifier +3 0 +1 -1 +1 +4   Score 16 11 12 9 12 18   Saving Throw +3 0 +1 -1 +3 +6    Skills:\r#\r\r Athletics: +5 Insight: +3 Intimidation: +6 Perception: +3 Persuassion: + 6  Background/Story:\r#\r\rNib [Sidekick]\r#\r\rStats:\r#\r\r   Max HP AC Inititive Prof B Total/Used Hit Die     22 13 +1 2 3/0        Strength Dexterity Constitution Intellect Wisdom Charisma     Modifier 0 +1 0 +2 +2 +1   Score 10 12 10 15 16 13   Saving Throw +0 +1 +0 +3 +4 +1    Skills:\r#\r\r Arcana: +4 Investigation: +4 Religion: +4  Items Held:\r#\r\r \rWand of Eldrich Blast 1/13 Used \rWand of Burning Hands \rStaff of Defense  Spellscasting\r#\r\rSpell Slots\r#\r\r Level 1: 3  Spells: (DC13 / +5 Hit)\r#\r\r  Cantrips:\n Guidance (Concentration)  Casting Time: 1 Action Components: V,S Duration: 1 Minute Range: Touch You touch one willing creature.
